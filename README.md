                            LEARNING OBJECTIVES
    The main learning objective which is the title of the assignment is to build
a Student and School database site. While exploring the tutorial link given above,
I got to learn a lot in this. I learned about how the filters work in the
schoolController.js & studentController.js files. I thought it was interesting how
the filters allowed you to type in a certain school into the url and it will filter
out any schools that aren't the specific one you searched for. I learned how the update
and remove functions work within the url for when you need to remove something or change 
something. A very important thing that I learned while coding was whie in your routes, your
ID route must come last or else you will get errors in your other routes if you are trying to
either update or remove something (or even if your trying to pull "get" info). 
              
                                 CHALLENGES
    In this project I ran into a few challenges. For instance, at the beginning 
I couldn't figure out how to install Turbo which I figured out it wouldn't
actually work due to the new Node.js. This was the first speed bump in the road 
that I ran into. After figuring that out I ran into my next challenge. Next I 
couldn't get my mlabs account and database to work. I eventually figured that all
that I needed to do was create the database user which was simple. There were a few 
places in my coding where I didn't capitalize a word, misspelled some words, and also
misplaced some brackets / parenthesis.
